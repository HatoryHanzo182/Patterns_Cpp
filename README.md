# Design patterns in C++

## About the project

Welcome to the "Patterns_Cpp" repository! Here you will find examples of using different design patterns in C++. This project is a set of implementations of popular patterns that will help you better understand how to use patterns to increase the flexibility and efficiency of your code.

## Important

This repository is under development and we are constantly adding new examples and improvements. The current version of the project represents only a small set of available patterns, and in the future we plan to expand it.

## Available patterns

At the moment, the following patterns are implemented in the project:

1. Pattern Abstract method.
2. Singleton pattern.
3. Pattern Abstract Factory.
4. Snapshot pattern.

Each pattern is accompanied by a demo that shows its application in different situations.
